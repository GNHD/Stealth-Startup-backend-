# Stealth-Startup-backend-
# Recommendation Collection API

This is a backend project built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** (hosted on **Neon**). The project allows users to create collections and manage recommendations (e.g., movies, TV shows, songs) within those collections.

## 1. Project Setup

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-collection-api.git
cd recommendation-collection-api
Install Dependencies:
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
2. Prerequisites
Node.js: Install it from nodejs.org.
PostgreSQL: Use Neon for the free PostgreSQL service (Neon.tech).
3. Database Setup
Set Up PostgreSQL on Neon:
Create an account and project on Neon.tech.
Go to Neon Console and find your Connection Details (host, port, username, password, and database name).
Add these credentials to the .env file.
Add the Credentials to the .env File:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_USER=your_neon_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_neon_password
DB_HOST=your_neon_host
DB_NAME=your_neon_database
DB_PORT=5432
Replace the placeholders with your Neon PostgreSQL credentials.

4. How to Run the Project
Start the Application:
Run the following command to start the server:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
The server will run on port 3000 by default. You should see:

plaintext
Copy code
Server is running on port 3000
5. How to Import Sample Data
Importing CSV Data into Neon:
Open the Neon SQL Console from the Neon Dashboard.
Upload CSV Files (users.csv and recommendations.csv) using the following commands:
For users.csv:

sql
Copy code
\COPY users FROM '/path/to/your/users.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
For recommendations.csv:

sql
Copy code
\COPY recommendations FROM '/path/to/your/recommendations.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
Ensure that your CSV files are formatted correctly with the necessary headers (e.g., id, user_id, title, etc.).

6. Testing the API
You can test the API using Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client.

API Endpoints
1. Create a Collection
Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/collections
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "name": "Favorites",
  "description": "Top picks"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "name": "Favorites",
  "description": "Top picks",
  "created_at": "2024-11-24T12:00:00.000Z"
}
2. View Recommendations in a Collection
Method: GET
Endpoint: /api/collections/:collectionId/recommendations
Example:
bash
Copy code
GET http://localhost:3000/api/collections/1/recommendations
Response: List of recommendations in the collection.
3. Add a Recommendation to a Collection
Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/recommendations/:collectionId
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "recommendation_id": 5
}
4. Remove a Recommendation from a Collection
Method: DELETE
Endpoint: /api/recommendations/:collectionId/:recommendationId
5. Delete a Collection
Method: DELETE
Endpoint: /api/collections/:collectionId
Example:
bash
Copy code
DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/collections/1
7. Assumptions
Database Schema:

Users Table stores information like name, profile picture, and bio.
Recommendations Table stores recommendations (e.g., movies, songs, books) related to users.
Collections Table stores collections created by users with a name and description.
Collection Recommendations Table is a join table linking recommendations to collections.
Authentication:

The API does not currently include user authentication; this should be implemented in a production environment (e.g., using JWT).
